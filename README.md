# ProjectWOPR - "Puzzle Cube"

What it is:
A box that opens (using an Aurdino) when you complete a game of Tic Tac Toe styled after War Games in Python.

Why I did It:
My Final Project for my CSCI 1470 Class (Intro to Programming). Having messed around with Aurdinos I was interested in the possibility of integration with Python. Moreover I wanted to explore the possibility of serial bus combination to and from the Aurdino unit. This project helped challenge my knowledge of both Python, Turtle, and Aurdino progamming.
